It combines structured news data from **NewsDataHub** with **AI summarization** to produce professional-grade intelligence reports.

**Use cases**

* Track emerging industry trends
* Generate executive summaries and contextual insights
* Analyze geographic coverage patterns
* Export PDF reports for stakeholders

---

## Demo

You can try the dashboard instantly — **no API keys required** — using the **demo topic mode**.

![Demo Mode](assets/setup-and-demo-topic.gif)

### How to Use Demo Mode

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newsdatahubapi/ai-market-intelligence-dashboard.git
   cd ai-market-intelligence-dashboard
   ```

2. Copy the environment files:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```

3. Start the application with Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

4. Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

5. Enter the demo topic in the search bar:
   ```
   "artificial intelligence"-demo
   ```

6. The app will instantly display:
   * Topic Analysis dashboard with charts and metrics
   * AI-Powered News Brief (main report)
   * Timeline Insights (pre-generated)
   * Regional Insights (pre-generated)

> 💡 **Note:** If you enter an unsupported demo topic, you'll see a 10-second toast notification suggesting valid alternatives. If you enter a regular topic without API keys configured, you'll see which environment variables need to be set.

**Currently supported demo topics:**

* `"artificial intelligence"-demo`

All demo responses are pre-cached JSON files and work without API access or network requests.

### Demo Implementation Details

**How It Works:**

* `isDemoMode(topic)` checks if topic ends with `-demo` suffix
* Demo data stored in `backend/src/demo-data/<topic>/`:
  * `topic-analysis.json` - Dashboard metrics and charts data
  * `context-analysis.json` - Main AI report
  * `context-geo.json` - Regional insights report
  * `context-spike.json` - Timeline insights report
  * `search-topic.json` - Articles for timeline
  * `country-coverage.json` - Articles for geographic analysis

**Backend Services:**

* `demoDataService.ts` - Core demo detection and data loading
* `topicAnalysisService.ts` - Returns demo data immediately for analysis
* `routes/news.ts` - Returns demo articles for search/country endpoints
* `routes/intelligence.ts` - Returns demo reports for AI insights

**Frontend Behavior:**

* Auto-triggers all three reports when demo topic is detected:
  1. Main AI-Powered News Brief
  2. Timeline Insights (for highest spike date)
  3. Regional Insights (for top country)
* 10-second toast notifications for unsupported topics or missing API keys

```

**Processing flow**

1. User enters a topic (e.g., "quantum computing") and selects date range.
2. Backend checks for demo mode (`-demo` suffix); if found, returns cached data.
3. For live queries, backend builds optimized NewsDataHub queries.
4. Articles are fetched, paginated, deduplicated.
5. Analysis pipeline extracts sentiment, geography, keywords, sources.
6. Results cached (1h for current day, 24h for historical).
7. OpenAI generates executive summaries and contextual insights.
8. Frontend renders charts, maps, and AI reports.
9. Reports exported to PDF.

---

## Prerequisites

* **Docker:** Latest stable version
* **Docker Compose:** v2.0 or higher
* **API keys (both required for live data):**

  * [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/) — for report generation
  * [NewsDataHub API key](https://newsdatahub.com) — for article data (free tier ≈ 100 calls/day; see site for current quotas)

> **Note:** Demo mode works without any API keys.

---

## Quick Start

### 1 · Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newsdatahubapi/ai-market-intelligence-dashboard.git
cd ai-market-intelligence-dashboard
```

### 2 · Configure Environment

Copy the example environment files:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

Then edit `backend/.env` and add your API keys:

```bash
NEWSDATAHUB_API_KEY=your_newsdatahub_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

> **Quick Start with Demo Mode:** You can skip adding API keys and use `"artificial intelligence"-demo` as your search topic to try the dashboard immediately.

### 3 · Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to access the dashboard and start analyzing news topics.

## Example Reports

You can view example exported PDF reports in the `example-reports/` directory. These demonstrate the three types of reports the dashboard can generate:

* `_gold-mining__News-Brief_2025-09-25-to-2025-10-25.pdf`
* `_quantum-computing__Regional-Insights_GB_2025-10-18-to-2025-10-25.pdf`
* `_semiconductors__Timeline-Insights_2025-10-16.pdf`

## FAQ

### **Demo Mode**

**Q: How do I use demo mode?**
Only one demo topic is currently supported: `"artificial intelligence"-demo`. Enter this topic in the search bar and the dashboard will load instantly using pre-cached JSON data. No API keys required.

**Q: Do I need API keys for demo mode?**
No. Demo mode works completely offline — no keys, no API requests.

**Q: Does the demo behave the same as live mode?**
Almost. All charts and reports display identically using stored data instead of real API responses. The main difference is that in demo mode, the Timeline Insights and Regional Insights reports are pre-generated and displayed automatically. In the live application, you would need to click on specific dates in the timeline chart or countries on the map to generate these reports.

**Q: What happens if I enter a non-existent demo topic?**
You'll see a 10-second toast message: `"This demo topic not supported. Try: "artificial intelligence"-demo"`

---

### **API Setup & Usage**

**Q: What API keys are required for live data?**
Both:

* `NEWSDATAHUB_API_KEY` – fetches news articles and metadata.
* `OPENAI_API_KEY` – generates summaries and insights.

**Q: What's the free tier for NewsDataHub?**
≈ 100 calls/day. Visit [newsdatahub.com](https://newsdatahub.com) for the latest quotas and pricing.

**Q: How much does OpenAI cost?**
Each report typically costs ~ $0.05 – $0.15 using `gpt-4o-mini`.

**Q: What happens if I try to use a real topic without API keys?**
You'll see a 10-second toast showing which environment variables are missing:
`"Missing API configuration. Please set the following environment variables: NEWSDATAHUB_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY"`

---

### **Development & Troubleshooting**

**Q: I'm getting "missing API key" errors.**

* Check `.env` in `/backend` for both `NEWSDATAHUB_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
* Ensure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in frontend points to the correct backend port.
* For quick testing, switch to demo mode.

**Q: My topic returns no articles.**

* Broaden the query (remove quotes or use fewer words).
* Extend the date range to 14–30 days.
* Confirm topic spelling.

**Q: Why is sentiment accuracy not perfect?**
This tutorial uses a keyword-based heuristic (~70–80% accuracy).
For production, replace with an ML model or specialized NLP API.

**Q: How can I change the model or prompt?**
Edit `backend/src/utils/promptUtils.ts`.
Modify `createIntelligenceReportMessages()` for tone/length, or `createContextExplanationMessages()` for drill-downs.

**Q: Can I add more visualization types?**
Yes — extend components in `frontend/src/components/charts/`.

**Q: How do I customize PDF styling?**
Modify the StyleSheet in `frontend/src/components/ExportReportPDF.tsx`.

**Q: How do I deploy this?**
This is a tutorial. For production:

* Add auth & DB, replace cache with Redis, enable HTTPS, monitoring, and rate limits.
